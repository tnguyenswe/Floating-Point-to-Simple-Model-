This program converts any floating point to the Simple Model, 1 bit for the sign, 5 bits for the exponent,
8 bits for the significand.

This was created for my CS77 Computer Organization and Architecture class!

This was programmed in Python, so you may want to download a Python IDE such as Pycharm to run it!
